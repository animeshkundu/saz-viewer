# GitHub Pages Deployment - Summary

## ✅ What's Been Set Up

Your SAZ Viewer is now **fully configured** for automatic GitHub Pages deployment. Here's what's in place:

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflow
**File**: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

- ✅ Triggers on every push to `main` branch
- ✅ Installs dependencies with `npm ci`
- ✅ Builds production app with `npm run build`
- ✅ Automatically sets correct base path using repository name
- ✅ Deploys `dist` folder to GitHub Pages

### 2. Vite Configuration
**File**: `vite.config.ts`

- ✅ Dynamic base path support via `process.env.VITE_BASE_PATH`
- ✅ Falls back to `'./'` for local development
- ✅ Works with any repository name (no hardcoding needed)

### 3. Documentation
- ✅ `README.md` - Project overview and deployment instructions
- ✅ `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Detailed deployment guide
- ✅ `CHECKLIST.md` - Step-by-step setup checklist
- ✅ `DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## 🚀 How to Deploy

### One-Time Setup (Required)

1. **Enable GitHub Pages** in your repository:
   ```
   Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions
   ```

### Automatic Deployment (Every Push)

2. **Just push to main**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your changes"
   git push origin main
   ```

That's it! GitHub Actions handles the rest automatically.

## 📍 Your Site URL

After deployment completes, your site will be live at:

```
https://<your-username>.github.io/<repository-name>/
```

**Example**: If your repo is `github.com/octocat/saz-viewer`, your site will be at:
```
https://octocat.github.io/saz-viewer/
```

## 🔍 Monitor Deployment

1. Go to **Actions** tab in your repository
2. Click on the latest "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
3. Watch the build and deploy steps
4. Look for the green checkmark ✅

**Average deployment time**: 2-3 minutes

## 🎯 What Happens on Each Push

```
1. You push to main
   ↓
2. GitHub Actions detects the push
   ↓
3. Workflow starts: Build job
   ├─ Checkout code
   ├─ Setup Node.js 20
   ├─ Install dependencies (npm ci)
   ├─ Build with correct base path
   └─ Upload dist folder
   ↓
4. Workflow continues: Deploy job
   ├─ Download build artifact
   └─ Deploy to GitHub Pages
   ↓
5. Your site is live! 🎉
```

## 📋 Quick Reference

| Action | Command/Location |
|--------|-----------------|
| Enable Pages | Settings → Pages → GitHub Actions |
| Push to deploy | `git push origin main` |
| Monitor build | Actions tab |
| View site | `https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/` |
| Build locally | `npm run build` |
| Test build | `npm run preview` |

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Workflow Fails

1. Check Actions tab for error details
2. Ensure `npm run build` works locally
3. Verify all dependencies are in `package.json`

### Site Shows 404

1. Wait 2-3 minutes after first deployment
2. Verify GitHub Pages source is set to "GitHub Actions"
3. Check Actions tab for successful deployment

### Assets Not Loading

1. Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)
2. Check browser console for 404 errors
3. Verify workflow completed successfully
